/*
Test!
Create a robot class that allows us to pickup and drop off cargo. This robot should have:

    A constructor that takes a parameter to set the max amount of cargo.

    A method name "pickupCargo" that takes a parameter specifying how much cargo we picked up and then increases our cargo count.
    Another method name "pickupCargo" that doesn't take a parameter and adds one to our cargo.

    A method named "dropCargo" that doesn't take a parameter and decreases our cargo by one.

    A method named "getCapacity" that returns how much room for cargo we have left.

    A method name "isFull" that tells us if we're at our cargo capacity.

Your robot starts with 0 cargo.
